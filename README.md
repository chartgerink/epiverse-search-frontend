# Epiverse search frontend

This repository hosts the frontend work, which automatically deploys using github pages. It hosts both the search, and the map functionality in one place. The `epiverse-search` and `epiverse-map` repo's are where the discussions around the entire project take place. This repository is only about the front-end.
